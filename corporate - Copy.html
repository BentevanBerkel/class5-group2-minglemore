        <b>UI patterns</b><br>
        <i>Responsive layout</i>:<br>
            Nothing is worse than switching devices and the design does not flow well after, making the user have to scroll in all dimentions in order to be able to read the text or watch the content. That is why we used a responsive layout, done via Bootstrap and JavaScript. Now the content of the page adjusts according to the size of the screen. Making the website user and device friendly.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-responsive2.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br><img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-responsive.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Buttons</i>:<br>
            To navigate through the pages and the content and have a clear overview of how to do that, buttons are used. These buttons perform a action. They have a bright color and in most cases even a hover-animation, so the user knows what is and is not a button.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-button.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Navigation bar (Navbar) with hamburger menu</i>:<br>
            In order to have a clear navigation the user needs to know where they are on the page and where they can go to. For this a navigation bar is implemented all the way on top of the page. It guides the user through the page with clear titles. When the screen is sized down, the Navbar will turn into a hamburger menu, making the display visible.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-navbar.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Scrollspy</i>:<br>
            Scrollspy has the same principle as the nevagation bar, only there is a visual cue on where in the navigation you are. This is done via scrolling. The navigation bar is place on the left side in a fixed position, so that it is always viable, no matter where on the page you are.
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-scrollspy.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Cards</i>:<br>
            Cards make sure that the responsive layout is working properly. It adds to the design as we can seperate items in colomns, but once sizing the screen up or down, or switching from devices, the cards will realign, making the cards properly visable and readable.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-cards.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Hover effect</i>:<br>
            For the user's convenience, the hover effect is used. This makes sure that the user knows that the site is working properly and make buttons more recognisable as buttons. Also hover effect is used to increase curiosity by making hte interface more interesting, like done with our values.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-hover-effect.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Dropdowns</i>:<br>
            In order to not clutter the screen full with navagational buttons, dropdown menus are used. This makes the overview for the user nice and clean. It stays organised while maintaining the ease to find everything.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-dropdowns.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Icons</i>:<br>
            To grow the posibility that people remember certain items and titles, and also to improve the recognision of a button, icons are used. This gives more meaning to the viewer when accessing a page.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-icons.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Tabels</i>:<br>
            For the corporate page it is nice to make the text visible to the reader, and display it in a clear way so that the overview is immediately understandable. Because of that, we used tabels in our corparate page.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-elements-tabels.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
            
        <b>Navigation structure</b><br>
            By using all these elements as listed above, the navigation structure becomes clear for the user. It makes for an easy to navigate site. With our visible and colorful branding we are easily recognisable and once stubling on the page, you immedietly know what our website's purpose is.<br>
            The values of the brand are visualised with the use of the bright and uplifting colors. These bride colors are meant to reflect the self-confidence the brand promises to the buyer.
            The marketing comes back in refering to the socials of Mingle More, this way there is a circle and the customer always knows how to find our brand. The navigation bar, buttons, and other design elements also help the customer in their experience of buying a product, making the marketing a pleasent experience. <br>
            The uniqie value proposal of the product is shown by the fact that once you arrive at the product page there is only one item there. Ofcourse in this case the customer is still able to adjust colors, or the masculine or feminine style, but by showcasing only one product, the focus is immedietly directed towards it and in doing so, it shows how this product is a unique piece with value.<br><br>

        <h2>Learning Points and Reflection</h2>
        <p>We at Mingle More launched a three-week Facebook marketing campaign to increase brand awareness and engagement. We posted content three to four times per week, but we lacked the time to create high-quality content. A learning point is that it would have been preferable to create content ahead of time, allowing for more time to clarify and improve our posts.<br>
        We as a team struggled at the start of the campaign to come up with content ideas that are engaging for our target audience. A learning point after posting three weeks in a roll content is that posts with a visual element, such as a graphic, video, picture with people, outperformed those without. We have more likes and engagement from the audience with this kind of content than with the others. For example, when we posted a picture with people on it, or a video again with people spending time together, was more appealing for the audience than a picture with a background and text on it. Furthermore, a picture of a person and a quote next to it is more likable by the audience than just a picture or just a quote. Posting to pictures (of our product) also was interesting for the audience since beforehand we introduced mostly or brand, some interesting facts about being a single middle-aged and made them feel curious about what else we had prepare for them.<br>
        Another key takeaway is the importance of being active and consistent on social media in order to build followers and generate buzz around the brand. We as a brand, had to post even more often, made more interesting posts such as games, questionaries to interact with our audience. <br>
        Overall, the campaign taught us that it is important to communicate our message to the target audience rather than just focusing solely on introducing our product. Moving forward at Mingle More we intend to improve our content planning and creating process while also continuing to prioritize our message and values in our marketing efforts.<br>
        Regarding the communication objectives we set at the beginning of the project, we could not meet them but with not too big a difference. Reach objectives: we expected to reach 100 people but instead of that we reached 86 people. We can say that the objective we set is realistic and the improvement we can make is to post more often content that sends our message and reach better the audience. Affect objective: we expected to have around 10 likes on each post but we have on some of them 7-8 likes and some of them less or none. That means we did not reach enough people and we have to improve our content and message. Responsive objectives: we expected to have 50 followers but instead we have 11. We did not meet our responsive objective and an improvement for that can be to make a better campaign, more catching the attention content, and interesting games or giveaways where people can participate and get engaged with the brand.<br>

        <h2>Future Planning</h2>
        <p>For our future we are even more excited now to improve our brand and social media after all learning points from this campaign.<br><br>
        <b>Future Recommandation</b><br>
        In the future, we would like to interact more with our audience, for instance, by collaborating with different brands or influencers in order to increase our brand awareness and interact with more people. We would like to host some events and workshops where people can meet, communicate, and, of course, buy and wear our product.<br>
        The reason behind these ideas is the importance of making real connections. We believe that this is the only way to meet people in real life, rather than just on social media. At Mingle More, we strongly follow our values and message, and we want to share this incredible experience with our target audience.<br><br>
        <b>Would do Differently</b><br>
        Well, at Mingle More we take the feedback and learning points as powerful tools for the development of our brand. We all agree that the thing that we would do differently is the planning. We had a good content planning but were not prepared with the exact content. Next time we would definitely make the content beforehand and instead of thinking at the same day what to post, we will have the content ready and we can think about improvements and more interesting activities that we can include in our next posts.<br><br>
