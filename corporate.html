        <b>UI patterns</b><br>
        <i>Responsive layout</i>:<br>
            Nothing is worse than switching devices and the design does not flow well after, making the user have to scroll in all dimentions in order to be able to read the text or watch the content. That is why we used a responsive layout, done via Bootstrap and JavaScript. Now the content of the page adjusts according to the size of the screen. Making the website user and device friendly.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-responsive2.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br><img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-responsive.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Buttons</i>:<br>
            To navigate through the pages and the content and have a clear overview of how to do that, buttons are used. These buttons perform a action. They have a bright color and in most cases even a hover-animation, so the user knows what is and is not a button.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-button.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Navigation bar (Navbar) with hamburger menu</i>:<br>
            In order to have a clear navigation the user needs to know where they are on the page and where they can go to. For this a navigation bar is implemented all the way on top of the page. It guides the user through the page with clear titles. When the screen is sized down, the Navbar will turn into a hamburger menu, making the display visible.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-navbar.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Scrollspy</i>:<br>
            Scrollspy has the same principle as the nevagation bar, only there is a visual cue on where in the navigation you are. This is done via scrolling. The navigation bar is place on the left side in a fixed position, so that it is always viable, no matter where on the page you are.
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-scrollspy.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Cards</i>:<br>
            Cards make sure that the responsive layout is working properly. It adds to the design as we can seperate items in colomns, but once sizing the screen up or down, or switching from devices, the cards will realign, making the cards properly visable and readable.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-cards.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Hover effect</i>:<br>
            For the user's convenience, the hover effect is used. This makes sure that the user knows that the site is working properly and make buttons more recognisable as buttons. Also hover effect is used to increase curiosity by making hte interface more interesting, like done with our values.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-hover-effect.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Dropdowns</i>:<br>
            In order to not clutter the screen full with navagational buttons, dropdown menus are used. This makes the overview for the user nice and clean. It stays organised while maintaining the ease to find everything.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-dropdowns.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Icons</i>:<br>
            To grow the posibility that people remember certain items and titles, and also to improve the recognision of a button, icons are used. This gives more meaning to the viewer when accessing a page.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-element-icons.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
        <i>Tabels</i>:<br>
            For the corporate page it is nice to make the text visible to the reader, and display it in a clear way so that the overview is immediately understandable. Because of that, we used tabels in our corparate page.<br>
            <img src="images/corporate-images/design-elements-tabels.png" alt="corporate" class="pro container-fluid"><br><br>
            
        <b>Navigation structure</b><br>
            By using all these elements as listed above, the navigation structure becomes clear for the user. It makes for an easy to navigate site. With our visible and colorful branding we are easily recognisable and once stubling on the page, you immedietly know what our website's purpose is.<br>
            The values of the brand are visualised with the use of the bright and uplifting colors. These bride colors are meant to reflect the self-confidence the brand promises to the buyer.
            The marketing comes back in refering to the socials of Mingle More, this way there is a circle and the customer always knows how to find our brand. The navigation bar, buttons, and other design elements also help the customer in their experience of buying a product, making the marketing a pleasent experience. <br>
            The uniqie value proposal of the product is shown by the fact that once you arrive at the product page there is only one item there. Ofcourse in this case the customer is still able to adjust colors, or the masculine or feminine style, but by showcasing only one product, the focus is immedietly directed towards it and in doing so, it shows how this product is a unique piece with value.<br><br>

        <h2>Context of Campaign and Promotional Activities</h2>
        <p>Mingle More is a brand dedicated to bringing together middle-aged singles who share common interests, hobbies, and passions. Our goal is to foster a sense of community among our members and to aid the creations of genuine, meaningful friendships and connections. Social media has evolved into an important part of todayâ€™s people life. However, we believe that the real human connections are bed made in person, where people can interact and engage in more meaningful ways.<br>
        Our Facebook marketing campaign in intended to raise awareness and encourage engagement and interaction among our target audience. We want to emphasize the value of real connections, as well as encourage people to make them.<br>

        <h2>Learning Points and Reflection</h2>
        <p>We at Mingle More launched a three-week Facebook marketing campaign to increase brand awareness and engagement. We posted content three to four times per week, but we lacked the time to create high-quality content. A learning point is that it would have been preferable to create content ahead of time, allowing for more time to clarify and improve our posts.<br>
        We as a team struggled at the start of the campaign to come up with content ideas that are engaging for our target audience. A learning point after posting three weeks in a roll content is that posts with a visual element, such as a graphic, video, picture with people, outperformed those without. We have more likes and engagement from the audience with this kind of content than with the others. For example, when we posted a picture with people on it, or a video again with people spending time together, was more appealing for the audience than a picture with a background and text on it. Furthermore, a picture of a person and a quote next to it is more likable by the audience than just a picture or just a quote. Posting to pictures (of our product) also was interesting for the audience since beforehand we introduced mostly or brand, some interesting facts about being a single middle-aged and made them feel curious about what else we had prepare for them.<br>
        Another key takeaway is the importance of being active and consistent on social media in order to build followers and generate buzz around the brand. We as a brand, had to post even more often, made more interesting posts such as games, questionaries to interact with our audience. <br>
        Overall, the campaign taught us that it is important to communicate our message to the target audience rather than just focusing solely on introducing our product. Moving forward at Mingle More we intend to improve our content planning and creating process while also continuing to prioritize our message and values in our marketing efforts.<br>
        Regarding the communication objectives we set at the beginning of the project, we could not meet them but with not too big a difference. Reach objectives: we expected to reach 100 people but instead of that we reached 86 people. We can say that the objective we set is realistic and the improvement we can make is to post more often content that sends our message and reach better the audience. Affect objective: we expected to have around 10 likes on each post but we have on some of them 7-8 likes and some of them less or none. That means we did not reach enough people and we have to improve our content and message. Responsive objectives: we expected to have 50 followers but instead we have 11. We did not meet our responsive objective and an improvement for that can be to make a better campaign, more catching the attention content, and interesting games or giveaways where people can participate and get engaged with the brand.<br>

        <h2>Future Planning</h2>
        <p>For our future we are even more excited now to improve our brand and social media after all learning points from this campaign.<br><br>
        <b>Future Recommandation</b><br>
        In the future, we would like to interact more with our audience, for instance, by collaborating with different brands or influencers in order to increase our brand awareness and interact with more people. We would like to host some events and workshops where people can meet, communicate, and, of course, buy and wear our product.<br>
        The reason behind these ideas is the importance of making real connections. We believe that this is the only way to meet people in real life, rather than just on social media. At Mingle More, we strongly follow our values and message, and we want to share this incredible experience with our target audience.<br><br>
        <b>Would do Differently</b><br>
        Well, at Mingle More we take the feedback and learning points as powerful tools for the development of our brand. We all agree that the thing that we would do differently is the planning. We had a good content planning but were not prepared with the exact content. Next time we would definitely make the content beforehand and instead of thinking at the same day what to post, we will have the content ready and we can think about improvements and more interesting activities that we can include in our next posts.<br><br>

            <b>Problems</b><br>
            <i>Loneliness</i><br>
            With the interviews we made we found out that most of the middle-aged singles feel lonely, not only because they do not have a partner, but because they do not have with whom to share their hobbies or go out. Most of their friends have partners in their life and our target group feel lonely around them when they talk mostly about their life with their partner or bring them everywhere.<br><br>
            <i>Difficulties finding new connections</i><br>
            Middle-aged singles find it difficult do meet new friends and find new connections. Most of the people at their age have a partner and spend most of the time with them. Our target audience wants to connect easier to new people, to share hobbies, go out, even without looking for a partner, just for a friendship.<br><br>
            <i>Not knowing the relationship status before approaching people</i><br>
            Middle-aged singles find it difficult to start a conversation with someone because they do not know their relationship status and feel that they will reject them. Even looking only for a friendship, they feel insecure and shy to start a new conversation with someone else.
            Link to the problem interviews can be found in the appendix.<br><br>

            <b>Solution</b><br>
            Bracelets. The idea we have as a solution to the problems our target audience faces is bracelets. There will be two types of bracelets: for men and women. There will be different colors of these bracelets that will mean something: the red one means you are looking for a relationship, the orange one means you are looking for a friend, the blue one means you are in a relationship, the green one is that you have kids and the purple one is you donâ€™t have kids. In that way when our target audience go out can reach easier to new people, know their relationship status beforehand, and not feel insecure to start a new conversation. The color of the bracelets can be changed when the person changes their relationship status and it is not necessary to buy a whole new bracelet, but they will have the option to buy only the color part of the product and change it.<br>
            This a fashionable way of solving the problems of our target audience and they can wear it even when they are not looking for a partner or new connections. We want them to feel happy, loved and to have someone to share their hobbies and time together. Either it is a partner or just a friend we believe people should know the importance of having real connections and the opportunity to share their favorites activities with other people.<br>
            Link to the solution interviews can be found in the appendix. <br><br>

            <b>Value Proposition</b><br>
            Mingle More believes that in a world dominated by social media, middle-aged singles require a safe and authentic space to connect with like-minded individuals. <br>

We believe that shared experiences are essential for developing long-term relationships. That is why we provide opportunities for our members to bond over shared interests, hobbies, and passions.<br><br>
            <b>Unfair Advantage</b><br>

            <b>Channels</b><br>
            <i>Facebook</i><br>
            Facebook will be used as a social media platform to reach out to our target audience, raise brand awareness, and gain followers. We will post on a regular basis and interact with the audience via comments and direct messages.<br><br>
            <i>Events</i><br>
            We will plan events and activities to bring our members together. There events will give them the chance to meet and connect in person.<br><br>
            <i>Word of mouth</i><br>
            We will rely on our target audience to spread awareness of our brand and its benefits. Members who are pleased with our services can refer their friends and family, expanding our reach and reputation.<br><br>
            <i>Influencers</i><br>
            Collaboration with relevant influencers in the middle-aged singles target can also assist us in broadening our reach and connecting potential customers who are interested in our brand values and products.<br><br>

            <b>Cost Structure</b><br>
            The materials we use to make our product are leather, stainless steel, and multi-chain closures. This is the break down of each componentâ€™s cost:<br><br>

            <i>Leather</i><br>
            One piece of leather costs 300 euros per square meter. The leather we are using is 90 cm wide and we need 360 strap to make our bracelets. Each strap is 15 cm long and 2 cm wide. Therefore, we get 50 straps from every 100 cm of leather (10 cm / 2 cm) and we need 7.2 meters (360 straps / 50 straps per 100 cm) of leather to make the bracelets. The cost of the leather we use is 159 euros. The cost of making one leather strap is 2.26 euros (159 euros / 360 straps).<br><br>
            <i>Stainless Steel</i><br>
            The stainless steel that we are using costs 9.22 euros per 1000 cm of 2.0 mm width. To make one bracelet, we need 64 cm stainless steel chain. Therefore, we can make 15 bracelets from every 1000 cm stainless steel chain (1000 cm / 64 cm). The cost of producing only one stainless steel strap is 1.63 euros (9.22 euros / 15 bracelets).<br><br>
            <i>Multi-chain closures</i><br>
            We are using multi-chain closures that cost 9.95 euros each. The cost of the multi-chain closure per bracelet is 9.95 euros.<br><br>

            Based on the cost of each material we are using, here is the calculation of making a female and male bracelet:<br><br>
            <i>Female bracelet:</i>
            The cost of making one leather strap is 2.26 euros and the cost of making one stainless steel strap is 1.63 euros. Adding the cost of the multi-chain closure, the total cost of making a female bracelet is 11.58 euros (2.26 euros + 1.63 euros + 9.95 euros).<br><br>
            <i>Male bracelet</i><br>
            The cost of making one leather strap is 2.26 euros and the cost of making one stainless steel strap is 1.63 euros. Adding the cost of the multi-chain closure, the total cost of making a male bracelet is 12.21 euros (2.26 euros + 1.63 euros + 9.95 euros).<br>
            Therefore, our cost structure of making the bracelets includes the cost of leather, stainless steel, and multi-chain closure, and the cost of making each bracelet depends on the gender of the bracelet.<br><br>
            <b>Revenue Streams</b><br>
            <i>Product sales:</i><br>
            We will generate revenue by selling our product through our web shop. Our cost of making a female bracelet is 11.58 euros, and our cost of making a male bracelet is 12.21 euros. We will sell our bracelets for 25 euros each for a base model with one color. If someone wants to add an extra color, they will have to pay an additional 7 euros. The profit we will make on each base model bracelet will be 13.42 euros (25 euros â€“ 11.58 euros) and for an extra color bracelet, the profit will be 6.42 euros (25 euros â€“ 11.58 euros â€“ 7 euros). However, we also need to consider any applicable taxes, such as VAT or sales tax, which may vary depending on our location and the location of our customers.<br><br>
            <i>Kickstarter:</i><br> 
            We are planning to use Kickstarter to fund our investments such as website and rural goods to make the product. This is a crowdfunding platform where people can support our production by pledging money, and in return, we can offer them rewards. These rewards can be early access to our products or other perks. The amount of revenue depend on how much money we are able to raise and how we structure our rewards.<br><br>
            <i>Sponsored content:</i><br>
            We will generate revenue as well by partnering with brands to create sponsored content. This includes blog posts, social media posts, or videos that promote their product in exchange for a fee. In our case we want to get influencers to wear our bracelets to create more awareness of our brand. The amount of revenue we generate from these partnerships will depend on the number of partnerships and the fees we charge for the content to create.<br><br>
            <b>Services/Productions</b><br>
            Mingle More, in addition to the community aspect, provides a unique product to help members connect in-person. Our product is a line of bracelets for both men and women that represent a member's desire to connect with others. The bracelets are available in a variety of colors and styles, allowing members to express themselves while also identifying as part of the Mingle More community.<br>
            Members can easily identify each other at events and gatherings by wearing the Mingle More bracelet, facilitating connections and conversations. The bracelets also serve as a reminder to prioritize in-person interactions and actively seek out opportunities to connect on a deeper level.<br>
            Our product is consistent with our brand identity and value proposition because it represents our community physically and reinforces our belief in the value of shared experiences. We intend to keep creating new designs and styles to appeal to a wide range of people and to enhance the sense of belonging in our community.<br><br>
            <b>Reflection After Solution Interviews</b><br>
            Following solution interviews with our customers, we learned that the majority of participants agree with our pricing structure for one bracelet and each additional color. They did, however, suggest that offering different packages, such as a box with one bracelet and three colors, a box with all colors, or a box with only the colors, would be a great idea. Participants who thought the price was too high were mostly men, and they suggested that we lower the price while also offering these different box options so customers could choose based on their needs. Furthermore, many participants expressed a desire for more designs of female bracelets that cater to various occasions.<br>
            We intend to offer different box options and expand our design selection for female bracelets in response to this feedback. We also intend to reduce the price of each bracelet from 25 to 20 euros in order to make them more affordable for customers while still generating sufficient revenue from sales.<br><br>

            <h2>Validation of Assumptions</h2>
            <p><b>Choices made</b><br>
            Mingle More conducted extensive research throughout the issue interviews phase to discover the pain points of middle-aged singles in looking for lasting relationships. We made several of decisions based on the feedback we obtained to ensure that our product is in line with our unique value proposition.<br><br>
            <b>Trademark</b><br>
            Choosing the name of our trademark was one of the most important decisions we made. We wanted a name that reflected our brand personality and principles while also being memorable and easily remembered. We chose "Mingle More" after considering several options because it captures our mission of providing a safe and authentic space for middle-aged singles to mingle and form more meaningful connections.<br><br>
            <b>Analysis</b><br>
            To confirm our trademark selection, we executed a market analysis of other possible choices. We discovered that the majority of dating and networking websites use generic names that convey no particular values or identity. Our name, on the other hand, is distinctive as it clearly communicates our emphasis on building personal connections and shared experiences.<br>
            Furthermore, during the problem interviews, we checked our trademark with potential customers and discovered that it stayed well with them. They liked the name's straightforward nature, and they thought it displayed our brand's mission and values.<br><br>
            <b>Existing Alternatives</b><br>
            Finally, our trademark "Mingle More" was chosen after thoroughly considering and evaluating existing alternatives. We believe it is consistent with our unique value proposition and brand identity and will assist us in establishing a strong market presence.
